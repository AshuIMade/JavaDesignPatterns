# Prototype Design Pattern
complicated objects like cars are not designed form scratch
what they do is they reiterate existing designs 
* an existing partial or fully constructed design is a prototype
* we make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
* but requires deep copy support
* we may make the cloning convenient may be factory 
* A prototype is a partially or fully intialized object that you copy (clone) and use it.
