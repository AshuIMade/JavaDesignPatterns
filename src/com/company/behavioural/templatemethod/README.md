# Template Method Design pattern
Algorithms can be decomposed in to the High level parts (Common Parts) and lower level parts or the specifics
## Strategy did this through Composition concrete implementations implement the interface
## Template Method does the same thing through inheritance 
* Overall Algorithm makes use of abstract member
* Inheritor overrides the abstract members 
* parent Template method is then invoked 
## Template method allows the skeleton of the algorithm,
## with concrete implementations defined in subclasses
