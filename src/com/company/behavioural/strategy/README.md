# Strategy Design pattern
Many Algorithms in to higher and lower parts
## example process of making tee can be decomposed in to higher 
* The higher part: the process of making a hot beverage (boil water, pour in to cup)
* Lower part: Tea specific things (put tea bag into water)
## The high level part can then be used to making hot chocolate or coffee
## then that will be supported by beverage specific strategies 
## The strategy dp also known as Policy dp enables the exact behaviour of a system 
## to be selected either at run time (dynamic) or compile time (static)
