# Mediator design pattern
Components may go in and out of a system at anytime.
example set of participants in chat room. or online game.
it makes no sense to have direct reference to participants because the particpants may go dead at any time
The solution is to have some sort of central component that facilitates communication.
## A mediator is a central component that facilitates communication between other components without benign aware of each other or having direct access to each other.
