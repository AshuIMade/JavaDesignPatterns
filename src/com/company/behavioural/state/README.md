# State Design pattern
consider a telephone. What to do with the telephone depends on the state of 
the telephone line.
* if it is ringing, or you want to make a call, you have to pick it up.
* phone must be off the hook to talk/ make a call.
* changes in state can be explicit or in response to event (observer pattern)
## the state design pattern is a pattern in which the objects behaviour is determined by its state.
## an object transition from one state to another (soimething needs to trigger the transition)
## a formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine.
