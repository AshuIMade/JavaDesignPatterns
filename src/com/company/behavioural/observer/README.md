# Observer design pattern
When we need to be informed when things happen
* like when object fields changes 
* object does something
* when some external event occurs
## we want to listen to events and notified when they occur
## an observer is an object that wishes to be informed about events that occur
## happening in the system. the events generating the events is an observable.
